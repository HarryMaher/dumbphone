# DumbPhone - The Smart Phone Replacement


### *Harry Maher* ###

A final project for my intro to python class. 
DumbPhone--*it makes your dumb phone smart!*


## *Description* ##

A Python program that runs (ideally on a server 24/7) for you to text for information
that you otherwise only get with a smart phone & data plan.

It uses Twilio to send/recieve messages.

## Why: ##
- Smartphones = soma/opium. (I recently kicked the habit...)
  - Current apps designed to catch & keep our attention--distracting us from real, important things
  - Too much screen time bad for mental health, memory, happiness
  - I made an attempt at designing a program to that performs some useful ("smart") functions but won't addict users

### Instructions ###

Clone this repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/HarryMaher/dumbphone
```

Read the docstrings for each of the functions if you want full functionality.
The first three functions require that you get your own API keys,
and the fourth requires that you have an android emulator

Current functions include:
1. *Weather* –  forecasts & current conditions (Wunderground API)
2. *Maps* – text-based directions (Google Maps API)
3. *Calendar* – view and add events (Calendar API)
4. *Limebike* – text bike number – android emulator does the rest (pyautogui)
5. *Chariot* – returns phone numbers for big city cab companies (a la Lyft)
6. *Tides* – tides of day (For less soggy beach naps)
7. *Sun* – what time it’ll set/rise ("Shabattify" - Dan O.)
8. *Goog* – “Smart answers” from a search engine. Scrapes smart answers.
